    the frequency of the interrupt overflow is determined by the

    freq = clock_frequency / ( 2 * prescaler * overflow_val)
    where prescaler can be 1, 8, 64, 256, or 1024
    clock_freq is 8MHz
    and overflow_val is 16bit

    the overflow value is placed in OCR1A, the prescale is set in TCCR1B
    so for example:
    A good POV frequency is around 400Hz
    desired freq = 400Hz
    clock freq = 8MHz
    8MHz / (400Hz * 2) = 10000
    since 10000 is less than 655536 (largest 16 bit number)
    OCR1A = 10000 and the prescale is 1
